Key features:

- Uses the image processing functions of TYPO3 to generate small preview images
- Original images will get loaded when they are in the viewport
- Write your own image processors.
- Use the processed images to match your page style, if you do not want to use the lazy loading part.
- Several useful configuration options.
- Easily extendable
